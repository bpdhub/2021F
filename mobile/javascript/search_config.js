Research Methodology                       To achieve the assigned objectives of the project, the BPD team took the follow-                     ing steps:                       1.    Survey Questionnaire                      2.    Follow-up Discussions with Faculty (based on faculty’s option)                     3.

Survey Questionnaire:                    The BPD team prepared a questionnaire with the aim to                   cover all the major objectives of the research consisting of                  both open-ended (65%) and close-ended (35%) questions.                  BPD team invited all the 23 faculty members to participate                   in an anonymous and confidential survey by providing an                  online questionnaire between October 5 to 11. Approxi-                   mately 60% of the population, 14 out of 23 faculty mem-                  bers, responded to the questionnaire (including one in-                  complete questionnaire).                                                                                                                 11","Scope of the study                    The study was conducted based on the valuable inputs from the faculty mem-                  bers who were available to engage and respond.                    Limitations of the study                      There was no influx of inputs beyond CNC’s think tank. This study is limited on-                      ly to the in-house reservoir of thoughts from the faculty and experts                     (articulation officer and Aboriginal recruitment officer) and these are absolutely                     important and valued. Expert talks from a neutral speaker for accreditation                      and someone from UNBC for articulation could have added another perspec-                     tive.                      A student survey could have been a critical part of the research data, because                     everything in this project revolved around the student interest; but due to a                      short time span, it was not feasible to create such a sampling plan and execute                     it.                      The time allotted for the study was a limiting factor. It was challenging for BPD                      members to justify teaching with this project, even though there was the re-                     lease time granted for this purpose.                      The COVID restrictions in place were another limiting factor, in person interac-                     tions were not possible.                                             12","Analysis of Data                                                                                                                                                             13","14","Q1: Do you feel that CNC business program needs improvement?                                       Findings                    Based on the basic objectives of the project, the questionnaire’s first question                    was explorative in nature. The question prompted whether the responding fac-                   ulty member felt that the business program needed improvements. The majori-                    ty of the respondents (85.71 percent) felt that the CNC business program need-                   ed improvements, while the rest (14.29 percent) were not sure.                                                                                                                                                15","Q2: What changes would you like to make in CNC business program and why?                                                                                              16","Q3: What do you like about the CNC business program?                                                             Findings                         41 percent of the respondents                        liked the CNC business program                        because of its applied approach.                        35 percent of respondents be-                        lieved that the best part of the CNC                        business program is the dedicated                        faculty.                         18 percent of respondents felt that the best part of the program are the moti-                        vated and dedicated students.                       6 percent of respondents believed that flexible approach of CNC business                        program makes it better than any other institution, e.g., it is not mandatory                        for students to complete it in two years in a cohort style program.                                                                                                                         17","Q4: Do you think CNC students require more time and support than university                     students?                                                   Findings                       The majority of the respondents (61.54 percent) believed that CNC students re-                      quire more time and support than university students. On the other hand, 38.46                     percent of respondents were of the viewpoint that CNC students are not differ-                     ent from the university students and there should be no extra time given to CNC                      students.                      In order to dig deeper, the questionnaire imposed an open-ended question to let                     faculty members reflect on the reasoning behind their thoughts.                                         18","Q5: Please elaborate on your answer of the previous question.

Findings                      Both schools of thoughts                    strongly believed that their ap-                     proach is in the best interest of                    students. Those in favour justi-                    fied that spending more time is                     important for the students’                    success.                      Others suggested that business faculty should work on                     making the business program more structured, and it                    should be focused on effective delivery and self-directed                    instructions to the students so that they are ready for                     the university.

Comm. re-                    quirements?                      The aforementioned statistic of 26 percent of                     CNC business students who transfer to UNBC                    was based off the inputs received from the ar-                    ticulation officer from the registrar’s office.                     This triggered a strong reason to make CNC                    courses seamlessly transferable. Mixed re-                     sponses came from the faculty— some faculty                    members strongly believed that it is a good idea, especially since it is important                    for students. However, CNC’s existing program might also be adding some value                     to the rest of the students. Thus, there were suggestions to explore the possibil-                    ity of adding a separate track for UT. This option might attract more domestic                     students as they will get maximum credits earned at CNC transferred to UNBC or                    some other institutions.

Justification of Analysis - There were some responses reflecting both the sides of                    the coin - making it hard for analysis to count percentage of respondents in fa-                     vour or against this. Thus, instead of calculating the percentage of faculty mem-                    bers in favour or against the idea, the number of arguments for both were tallied.                         20","Q7: What changes (if any) would you make in the current program to better                    prepare students that are entering the workforce?                                                             Findings                      Most of the faculty respondents                    suggested that the business pro-                     gram should engage more with                    the local business community.                    As per the responses, such en-                     gagements might facilitate stu-                    dents in getting work-integrated                     learning (WIL) and inputs from                    the business community to up-                    date the course curriculum. Also, there were suggestions to develop an entrepre-                     neurial and placement cell to support the business students.                                                                                                                        21","Q8: Would you be willing to adjust your courses to make them more transfera-                    ble?                                                          Findings                      The respondents were willing to make changes given that they were proven to be                     useful for students. The majority of the responses (62 percent) were strongly in                    favor of making changes to their courses, whereas others stated that they would                     do it depending on the importance and need of bringing in such change.                      It is a good idea to have a third-party standardization authority to navigate the                    changes in the right directions for the betterment of our students. One such au-                    thority in this direction could be accreditation. BPD wanted to know from the fac-                     ulty if they are aware of accreditation as a next question in this direction.                               22","Q9: Do you feel you are familiar with accreditation and its pros and cons?                                            Findings                      The majority of respondents (54 percent) were not sure if they familiar with ac-                    creditation, whilst 31 percent said that they knew the pros and cons of the ac-                     creditation. The remaining 15 percent respondents stated that they had no idea                    about accreditation’s pros or cons and, by extension, what it would mean for                     CNC.                   Q10: Would you be interested in learning more about accreditation and its im-                     plications for our program?                      As expected, the majority                     of responses (92.31 per-                    cent) from the respond-                     ents showed interest in                    learning more about ac-                    creditation and its impli-                     cations for the business                    program.                                                                                                                  23","Q11: Would you be willing to volunteer for a committee in your subject area for                      continuous improvement of your program/courses?                                                The majority of the respondents (76.92 percent) responded that they would be                    willing to volunteer for a committee in their subject area for the purpose of con-                     tinuous improvement of their courses and the program; whereas 23.08 percent                    did not want to volunteer for such a committee.                     Q13: Are you willing to speak to us further about your answers?                    For the purpose of getting a better understanding and insight of business faculty,                     BPD team invited the respondents for engaging in a follow-up discussion around                    these topics in the questionnaire. BPD team invited everyone if they wish to en-                     gage in individual discussion, and once again this discussion would be kept confi-                    dential.                      The BPD team appreciates that 76.92 percent of the respondents were interested                    in meeting. The BPD team organized a scheduled questionnaire based meeting                     consisting of two members from BPD group and one interested faculty members                    individually. These meetings were both in person and via zoom as per the con-                     venience of the faculty members.                       24","Recommendations                                                                                                                                                       25","26","REFLECTION AND RECOMMENDATIONS                         All responses (collected using an online questionnaire and follow-up discussion                     sessions with business faculty members) were compelling. On the top of this, eye                    -opening inputs came from the talks with experts — Laura Buchi, Articulation                    Officer from the Office of the Registrar office and Patricia Prince and  Dawn                     George, the Aboriginal Recruitment Officers at CNC.                       The BPD team boiled down all their thoughts and is submitting its report and rec-                    ommendations to the dean’s office for any further action plan. For the purpose                     of keeping it organized, the recommendations are divided into the following sec-                    tions.                 1)    BPD REPORT ON ABORIGINAL STUDENTS                 2)                                                                                                                                                          27","BPD REPORT ON ABORIGINAL STUDENTS                       In order to ensure the progressive approach of Business Pro-                    grams in the right directions, it is important to focus on Aborigi-                     nal student needs and problems. So, with an aim to get critical                    feedback to improve, the BPD group met with Aboriginal Re-                     cruiting Officers at CNC —  Patricia Prince and Dawn George.                    The following are the inferences based on the discussions held                    with Aboriginal Recruiting officers, as well as suggestions                     from the business faculty.                   Let’s start with these Positive Vibes                     COVID has forced many changes in all spheres of professional life, teaching,                     and delivery of instructions to students. One such big change resulted in Hybrid                    and HyFlex learning model with an advantage of both online and face to face                     instructions with great flexibility.                        Aboriginal students experienced  HyFlex and Hybrid model of teaching as a                        convenient approach to learning because it allows them to choose not to                         leave their community for the purpose of study. Students are opting and                        switching to the courses that are offered online so that they can stay with                         their community while studying.                        Further, there was a recommendation stating that it might be a good idea to                        have some class sections meet face (F2F), whereas keeping others online. This                        will allow students to choose whether they want to come to the Prince                         George campus, or have their classes accessible remotely.                        There may be an opportunity to use the remote setups that might already be                         existing in territories and arrange DDI like setup by optimally utilizing their                        community’s existing resources.                     28","Problems/Challenges Faced by Aboriginal Student Population                      Transferability issues: After completion of CNC diploma, students end up not                       meeting the requirements for other universities such as the University of                        Northern British Columbia (UNBC).                      Lack of Flexibility: Core and business elective combinations leave less room for                       students to pick University Transfer (UT) courses.                      Challenging to succeed: In the beginning, students hope to get business and                        accounting related courses with the hope to find an office job, but somehow                       courses like Accounting and Math seem to become challenging for them. Abo-                        riginal students end up shifting from Accounting courses to Management ones.                  Suggestions/Recommendations                      Sponsorship: There are some third-party funders, it’s not just band funders,                        rather there are recipients of social assistance or EI. It is important to be cogni-                       zant that some sponsors won’t allow students anything beyond what is men-                       tioned/listed in the requirements of the course, for e.g., calculator, laptop, etc.                        So it is recommended to add some standard list of tools required to be suc-                       cessful for a business programs so that students face no problem to seek ap-                        proval from their sponsors.                      Credits and hours: Even though there is a separate report regarding hours, this                       one is related to Aboriginal students in particular. Some bands have specific                       requirement policies as to how many courses students need to take in a se-                        mester. On top of that, longer credit hours required to earn such courses/                       credits would make it challenging for aboriginal students.                       Pre-Business Access: Investigate BC Adult dogwood program’s math require-                       ments and design access to pre-business access options.                      Block transfer: As aboriginal recruiting officer, Patricia would like to know if stu-                       dents can’t get transferred to UNBC where else they could be guided for. So,                                                                                                                 29","any kind of agreement with UNBC or any other university to have block trans-                       fer for the courses would be a great value addition.                       Aboriginal students join the business program with entrepreneurial mindset                       with the hope to develop their own business; some support is required for                       such students. CE courses do not work for band sponsored students because                        these are not accredited.                      Further, in order to seek direct feedback from                       aboriginal students, consider working with                        Bruce Allan, Aboriginal Studies Instructor. It might                       be organizing a talking circle event with Aborigi-                        nal students to seek direct feedback in order to                       understand their challenges and improve the                       courses and programs.                 BPD Suggestion-                    It is difficult to say what we need to do in order to move our course delivery                   more towards indigenization. After discussion with various members, it seems                  that we all might already be doing it. So, it is recommended to:                      Carefully craft and professionally draft some text as an acknowledgement to                        traditional territories of CNC campus locations.                      This acknowledgement text may be in the form of some kind of paragraph to                       be included in our course outlines, and let it be a standard part of template                        for all the courses at business.                      It may be a small step and signal a sense of respect and welcoming attitude of                       inclusion by CNC to all students in the class.                              30","ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS                 Our Special thanks to all of you who provided us the valuable inputs/support  -                    Laura Buchi, Articulation Officer from the Office of the Registrar, deserves the                   heartiest thanks for all the valuable inputs she provided BPD team during the                  whole process of the research.
