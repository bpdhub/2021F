Survey Questionnaire                      2.    Follow-up Discussions with Faculty (based on faculty’s option)                     3.

Survey Questionnaire:                    The BPD team prepared a questionnaire with the aim to                   cover all the major objectives of the research consisting of                  both open-ended (65%) and close-ended (35%) questions.                  BPD team invited all the 23 faculty members to participate                   in an anonymous and confidential survey by providing an                  online questionnaire between October 5 to 11. Approxi-                   mately 60% of the population, 14 out of 23 faculty mem-                  bers, responded to the questionnaire (including one in-                  complete questionnaire).                                                                                                                 13","Scope of the study                    The study was conducted based on the valuable inputs from the faculty mem-                  bers who were available to engage and respond.                    Limitations of the study                      There was no influx of inputs beyond CNC’s think tank. This study is limited on-                      ly to the in-house reservoir of thoughts from the faculty and experts                     (articulation officer and Aboriginal recruitment officer) and these are absolutely                     important and valued. Expert talks from a neutral speaker for accreditation                      and someone from UNBC for articulation could have added another perspec-                     tive.                      A student survey could have been a critical part of the research data, because                     everything in this project revolved around the student interest; but due to a                      short time span, it was not feasible to create such a sampling plan and execute                     it.                      The time allotted for the study was a limiting factor. It was challenging for BPD                      members to justify teaching with this project, even though there was the re-                     lease time granted for this purpose.                      The COVID restrictions in place were another limiting factor, in person interac-                     tions were not possible.

Findings                       The majority of the respondents (61.54 percent) believed that CNC students re-                      quire more time and support than university students. On the other hand, 38.46                     percent of respondents were of the viewpoint that CNC students are not differ-                     ent from the university students and there should be no extra time given to CNC                      students.                      In order to dig deeper, the questionnaire imposed an open-ended question to let                     faculty members reflect on the reasoning behind their thoughts.                                         20","Q5: Please elaborate on your answer of the previous question.

Those in favour justi-                    fied that spending more time is                     important for the students’                    success.                      Others suggested that business faculty should work on                     making the business program more structured, and it                    should be focused on effective delivery and self-directed                    instructions to the students so that they are ready for                     the university.

Comm. re-                    quirements?                      The aforementioned statistic of 26 percent of                     CNC business students who transfer to UNBC                    was based off the inputs received from the ar-                    ticulation officer from the registrar’s office.                     This triggered a strong reason to make CNC                    courses seamlessly transferable. Mixed re-                     sponses came from the faculty— some faculty                    members strongly believed that it is a good idea, especially since it is important                    for students. However, CNC’s existing program might also be adding some value                     to the rest of the students. Thus, there were suggestions to explore the possibil-                    ity of adding a separate track for UT. This option might attract more domestic                     students as they will get maximum credits earned at CNC transferred to UNBC or                    some other institutions.                                                                     Others, however, believed that it would                                                                   be a wasteful effort, and most of the                                                                    thoughts were to be cautious not to                                                                   target solely on the needs of one uni-                                                                    versity (UNBC). There were some in-                                                                   puts regarding similar efforts done in                                                                   the past to facilitate CNC to UNBC di-                                                                    rect transfer that did not mature.                     Justification of Analysis - There were some responses reflecting both the sides of                    the coin - making it hard for analysis to count percentage of respondents in fa-                     vour or against this. Thus, instead of calculating the percentage of faculty mem-                    bers in favour or against the idea, the number of arguments for both were tallied.                         22","Q7: What changes (if any) would you make in the current program to better                    prepare students that are entering the workforce?                                                             Findings                      Most of the faculty respondents                    suggested that the business pro-                     gram should engage more with                    the local business community.                    As per the responses, such en-                     gagements might facilitate stu-                    dents in getting work-integrated                     learning (WIL) and inputs from                    the business community to up-                    date the course curriculum. Also, there were suggestions to develop an entrepre-                     neurial and placement cell to support the business students.                                                                                                                        23","Q8: Would you be willing to adjust your courses to make them more transfera-                    ble?                                                          Findings                      The respondents were willing to make changes given that they were proven to be                     useful for students. The majority of the responses (62 percent) were strongly in                    favor of making changes to their courses, whereas others stated that they would                     do it depending on the importance and need of bringing in such change.                      It is a good idea to have a third-party standardization authority to navigate the                    changes in the right directions for the betterment of our students. One such au-                    thority in this direction could be accreditation. BPD wanted to know from the fac-                     ulty if they are aware of accreditation as a next question in this direction.                               24","Q9: Do you feel you are familiar with accreditation and its pros and cons?                                            Findings                      The majority of respondents (54 percent) were not sure if they familiar with ac-                    creditation, whilst 31 percent said that they knew the pros and cons of the ac-                     creditation. The remaining 15 percent respondents stated that they had no idea                    about accreditation’s pros or cons and, by extension, what it would mean for                     CNC.                   Q10: Would you be interested in learning more about accreditation and its im-                     plications for our program?                      As expected, the majority                     of responses (92.31 per-                    cent) from the respond-                     ents showed interest in                    learning more about ac-                    creditation and its impli-                     cations for the business                    program.                                                                                                                  25","Q11: Would you be willing to volunteer for a committee in your subject area for                      continuous improvement of your program/courses?                                                The majority of the respondents (76.92 percent) responded that they would be                    willing to volunteer for a committee in their subject area for the purpose of con-                     tinuous improvement of their courses and the program; whereas 23.08 percent                    did not want to volunteer for such a committee.                     Q13: Are you willing to speak to us further about your answers?                    For the purpose of getting a better understanding and insight of business faculty,                     BPD team invited the respondents for engaging in a follow-up discussion around                    these topics in the questionnaire. BPD team invited everyone if they wish to en-                     gage in individual discussion, and once again this discussion would be kept confi-                    dential.                      The BPD team appreciates that 76.92 percent of the respondents were interested                    in meeting. The BPD team organized a scheduled questionnaire based meeting                     consisting of two members from BPD group and one interested faculty members                    individually. These meetings were both in person and via zoom as per the con-                     venience of the faculty members.

On the top of this, eye                    -opening inputs came from the talks with experts — Laura Buchi, Articulation                    Officer from the Office of the Registrar office and Patricia Prince and  Dawn                     George, the Aboriginal Recruitment Officers at CNC.                       The BPD team boiled down all their thoughts and is submitting its report and rec-                     ommendations to the dean’s office for any further action plan. For the purpose                    of keeping it organized, the recommendations are divided into the following sec-                    tions.                             1)    ACCREDITATION                             2)    ARTICULATION/ ALTERNATIVE SEPARATE TRACK                             3)    COURSE HOURS                             4)    CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT                             5)    INDIGENIZATION OF BUSINESS PROGRAM                                                                                                                                                  29","ACCREDITATION OF BUSINESS PROGRAM                         Accreditation remains a topic for further exploration.  It became clear in our re-                    search that  accreditation questions were secondary to the more immediate op-                    portunities and issues of articulation.                        We also came to understand that accreditation might be most appealing as a                    means to provide structure for ongoing program and course review, rather than                     transferability as we doubt it would make much difference without more work on                    articulation.                       The majority of the business faculty indicated curiosity about accreditation, what                     it means, how it could benefit, what it would cost, how much would it impact aca-                    demic freedom, if at all etc.                        Further, during our research it became apparent that articulation and other are-                    as were the most immediately obvious and actionable areas to address. It was                     also clear that the greatest benefit from accreditation might be the framework it                    provides for continuous self-evaluation and improvement rather than the trans-                    ferability of CNC credentials.                        According to the AACSB website accreditation means:                              Commitment to upholding and advancing the highest quality programs                           Connection to businesses to develop the talent they are looking to hire to-                           day and, in the future                             Relevance of curriculum and learning material to students’ field of study                           and to today’s workforce.                            Societal Impact focus on global prosperity and creating impactful leaders                   30","     Quality in the highest-caliber faculty, leading-edge courses, and innovative                           programs                             Continuous improvement framework for constant measurement of success                      All the above are appealing, and accreditation might be an effective way to en-                     sure systematic evaluation and continuous improvement of our business pro-                    gram. The question is, “how much do we need an external body to evaluate us in                     this endeavour?                       An anecdotal flag of caution against AACSB accreditation is the list of schools par-                    ticipating in the program. Participants tend to be universities (e.g., UBC and                     Queens etc.) with quite different academic agendas to CNC’s community educa-                    tion access mandate.                        The formal accreditation option has proved to be a moot discussion, for the time                    being anyway, because we have learned from an AACSB representative that for-                    mal accreditation is only offered to institutions offering baccalaureate degrees                     and higher. Now if there was an accreditation or association of community col-                    lege business programs, that would be interesting!                        BPD’S RECOMMENDATION:                       Our recommendation is to study accreditation with an eye to developing our own                    internal continuous course evaluation and continuous improvement system,                     which we need with or without a formal accreditation commitment; and                       Our recommendation is to continue researching accreditation costs and benefits                     including two guest speakers, one from the accreditation body itself and one or                    two from participating institutions similar to CNC who can give us a possibly                     more balanced perspective on what’s involved and what we could expect from it.                                                                                                                       31","ARTICULATION/ ALTERNATIVE SEPARATE TRACK                         In conversations with the Laura Buchi, CNC’s articulation officer two things be-                    came apparent.  26% of CNC students do proceed to upper division institutions,                    and 90+% of these go to UNBC.                        The second thing we learned was that although most of our classes do transfer                    to UNBC and elsewhere for elective credits, many course in the current diploma                    program do not match up with UNBCs lower division course requirements, which                     results in extending the number of semesters transferring students must take                    toward a BCom Degree at upper division schools.                        We believe this situation may discourage especially local students from beginning                    their studies at CNC and disappointing some that do.  (We have reason to believe                    most transferring students are local, but we have no data on foreign students                     who proceed to upper division degree programs as they have an incentive to de-                    fer application until after achieving residency status).                       BPD’S RECOMMENDATION:                        Given the above, we recommend the CNC Business faculty should establish an                    alternative UT Diploma track populated with courses that more closely                     match the lower division BComm course requirements at UNBC in articula-                    tion. We also recommend establishing an ongoing dialog with UNBC toward a                    block transfer option.                        We believe an alternative path to a diploma is valuable and necessary because                    the UNBC lower division courses are more technical and less well-rounded than                    the courses a “terminal” degree business student should take to prepare them                     for immediate launch into various fields of business. Under the current single-                    track regime, students who take CNC courses with an eye to upper-division trans-                     fer, graduate without a credential. This is out of synch with current educational                 32","trends toward micro-credentials.                       A draft UT Track Course outline for is                     included in the exhibits to this report                    for discussion and refinement.                    These are the courses CNC Offers that                     would be most likely to support                    a transfer of maximum credits towards                     year 3 of a BComm at UNBC and will                    facilitate negotiation of block transfer agreements with UNBC and other schools.

Some BPD committee members have reported inquiries from students wishing                    to continue their studies beyond 2nd year at CNC. Such a “Business Foundations”                    diploma track would potentially also support the development of a BBA creden-                     tial at CNC if that were deemed beneficial at some point.                                                                                                                              33","COURSE HOURS                       The Business program prides itself on using the applied approach                     for student learning.  CNC students learn skills to use in the re-                    al world through projects, team exercises, computers                    labs and other techniques.  Learning these applied                     skills take time and additional hours of classroom                    and/or lab time are needed.  According to our survey of                     participating business faculty, the majority do believe                    that CNC students require more time and support than university students.                       The request of the business program development committee was to research                     the number of additional hours students are required to complete a course at                    CNC in comparison to other institutions.                        2 colleges in BC that offered business management diplomas were polled (results                    can be shared if requested) – College of the Rockies and Langara.                        Out of the 20 required courses for College of the Rockies, only 1 was a 4-hour lec-                    ture and another had a lab for 2 hours.  The remaining 18 were scheduled for 3-                    hour lectures.  All courses were for 3 credits.                        Langara College had more courses with additional hours – 13 courses with labs                    from 1 – 2 hours and 13 courses with 4 hour lectures.  No course was over 4                    hours/week.  All courses were 3 credits.                        BPD’S RECOMMENDATION:                       Instructors should be required to thoroughly assess any courses that have a lab                     and/or lecture over 3 hours to see if hours can be reduced without jeopardizing                    CNC’s mission of offering applied skills.  Alternatives should be reviewed and all                    instructors that are involved with the course should have input.                   34","CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT                       In communicating with our                     business faculty through our                    survey and interviews, we have                    concluded that many of our                     courses (syllabi, objectives, pre-                    requisites, etc.) are outdated                     (some by many years). We be-                    lieve that our business courses                    do need to be updated to current standards but to remain current, we should be                     developing continuous improvement policies within our department.                       BPD’S RECOMMENDATION:                        Create departmental committees (accounting, business, marking, etc.) so that in-                    structors in similar programs can meet and review outlines, objectives, new                    course offerings among other improvements.  The committees should meet at                     the beginning of the semester to set up any changes needed and ending of each                    semester to review the wins/losses of those changes. (Intersession would be                     based on availability).                                                                                                                                               35","INDIGENIZATION OF BUSINESS PROGRAM                       In order to ensure the progressive approach of Business Programs in                    the right directions, it is important to focus on Aboriginal student                     needs and problems. So, with an aim to get critical feedback to im-                    prove, the BPD group met with Aboriginal Recruiting Officers at                     CNC —  Patricia Prince and Dawn George. The following are the in-                    ferences based on the discussions held with Aboriginal Recruiting                    officers, as well as suggestions from the business faculty.                     Let’s start with these Positive Vibes                      COVID has forced many changes in all spheres of professional life, teaching,                    and delivery of instructions to students. One such big change resulted in Hybrid                    and HyFlex learning model with an advantage of both online and face to face                     instructions with great flexibility.                        Aboriginal students experienced  HyFlex and Hybrid model of teaching as a                         convenient approach to learning because it allows them to choose not to                        leave their community for the purpose of study. Students are opting and                        switching to the courses that are offered online so that they can stay with                         their community while studying.                        Further, there was a recommendation stating that it might be a good idea to                        have some class sections meet face (F2F), whereas keeping others online. This                         will allow students to choose whether they want to come to the Prince                        George campus, or have their classes accessible remotely.                        There may be an opportunity to use the remote setups that might already be                         existing in territories and arrange DDI like setup by optimally utilizing their                        community’s existing resources.                       36","Problems/Challenges Faced by Aboriginal Student Population                      Transferability issues: After completion of CNC diploma, students end up not                       meeting the requirements for other universities such as the University of                        Northern British Columbia (UNBC).                      Lack of Flexibility: Core and business elective combinations leave less room for                       students to pick University Transfer (UT) courses.                       Challenging to succeed: In the beginning, students hope to get business and                       accounting related courses with the hope to find an office job, but somehow                       courses like Accounting and Math seem to become challenging for them. Abo-                        riginal students end up shifting from Accounting courses to Management ones.                  Suggestions/Recommendations                      Sponsorship: There are some third-party funders, it’s not just band funders,                        rather there are recipients of social assistance or EI. It is important to be cogni-                       zant that some sponsors won’t allow students anything beyond what is men-                       tioned/listed in the requirements of the course, for e.g., calculator, laptop, etc.                        So it is recommended to add some standard list of tools required to be suc-                       cessful for a business programs so that students face no problem to seek ap-                        proval from their sponsors.                      Credits and hours: Even though there is a separate report regarding hours, this                       one is related to Aboriginal students in particular. Some bands have specific                        requirement policies as to how many courses students need to take in a se-                       mester. On top of that, longer credit hours required to earn such courses/                       credits would make it challenging for aboriginal students.                       Pre-Business Access: Investigate BC Adult dogwood program’s math require-                       ments and design access to pre-business access options.                      Block transfer: As aboriginal recruiting officer, Patricia would like to know if stu-                        dents can’t get transferred to UNBC where else they could be guided for. So,                                                                                                                 37","any kind of agreement with UNBC or any other university to have block trans-                       fer for the courses would be a great value addition.                       Aboriginal students join the business program with entrepreneurial mindset                       with the hope to develop their own business; some support is required for                       such students. CE courses do not work for band sponsored students because                        these are not accredited.                      Further, in order to seek direct feedback from                       aboriginal students, consider working with                        Bruce Allan, Aboriginal Studies Instructor. It might                       be organizing a talking circle event with Aborigi-                        nal students to seek direct feedback in order to                       understand their challenges and improve the                       courses and programs.                    BPD’S RECOMMENDATION:                    It is difficult to say what we need to do in order to move our course delivery                   more towards indigenization. After discussion with various members, it seems                  that we all might already be doing it. So, it is recommended to:                      Carefully craft and professionally draft some text as an acknowledgement to                        traditional territories of CNC campus locations.                      This acknowledgement text may be in the form of some kind of paragraph to                       be included in our course outlines, and let it be a standard part of template                       for all the courses at business.                       It may be a small step and signal a sense of respect and welcoming attitude of                       inclusion by CNC to all students in the class.
